* magit "standalone version"
[[http://magit.vc/][Magit]] is a fantastic git frontend for emacs. Altough it is an
important part of my emacs workflow, I sometimes work in gitrepository
on the naked commandline. Up until now I resolved to tig to get a fast
and feature-rich text ui for simple commits, ammends, diffs when pure
git was not right for me.

This is a minimal emacs configuration that mimics tig but with the
magit implementation.

** Installation
The installation is tested with emacs 25.1.1.

Clone the repository to =~/.magit=. One or all of the following:
- make an alias that calls =emacs -q --load ~/.magit/init.el=.
- put .magit in your path and call =magit=.
- link =~/.magit/magit= to magit in a directory in your path.

** Usage
This is to 99.99999% the default emacs configuration. So the almost all
emacs users will be fine. For all the other users the most importation
shortcut would be =C-x-c= which means hold Ctrl-Key and press first x
and then c.

Please refer to the excellent [[http://magit.vc/manual/magit/#Top][user manual]] on how to work with magit.

** Uninstallation
If you don't like it, simple delete =~/.magit= and you are done.

** Implementation / Tuning
- To switch to the local "magit" configuration the trick in
  [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/4258/11102][stackoverflow]] is used.
- [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]] is used to make sure magit with all dependencies is
  available.
- I added my favorite [[https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs][color-theme]] to the mix.
- All customizations are done directly in init.el to keep the startup
  time as small as possible. Feel free to adjust the settings to your
  liking.
